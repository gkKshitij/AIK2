1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch of your name
3. Make the required changes, commit them to your branch
4. Contribute and open pull request
5. Always mention what you have done in comment then submit

Then the maintainer/owner (in this case me) will check it and merge it to the main branch if everything is fine..
